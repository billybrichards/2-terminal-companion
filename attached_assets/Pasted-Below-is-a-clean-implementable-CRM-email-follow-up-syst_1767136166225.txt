Below is a **clean, implementable CRM + email follow-up system** mapped **directly** from the funnels you designed.
This is written so you can hand it to **growth / ops / no-code** and they can build it without interpretation.

I’ll cover:

1. CRM structure (fields + tags)
2. Funnel → CRM mapping
3. Email sequences (waitlist vs direct)
4. Timing logic
5. Refund + trust handling
6. Why this improves feedback quality (important for you)

No fluff. No “marketing automation” nonsense.

## 1. CRM STRUCTURE (SIMPLE, HUMAN)

Use **one primary table**: `users_leads`

### Core Fields

* `email`
* `funnel_type` → (`waitlist` | `direct`)
* `persona` → (`lonely` | `curious` | `privacy`)
* `entry_source` → (instagram, tiktok, reddit, search, retargeting)
* `started_at`
* `last_activity_at`
* `converted_to_paid` (true/false)
* `plan` → (`0.99_lifetime` | `2.99_monthly` | null)
* `refund_requested` (true/false)
* `refund_processed` (true/false)

### Behavioral Flags (important)

* `used_free_messages` (0–3)
* `opened_email_1/2/3`
* `clicked_use_app`
* `feedback_submitted` (true/false)

This is enough. Don’t over-engineer.

---

## 2. FUNNEL → CRM TAGGING LOGIC

### On Funnel Completion

When user finishes questions:

**Apply tags:**

* `persona:lonely` OR `persona:curious` OR `persona:privacy`
* `funnel_type:waitlist` OR `funnel_type:direct`
* `stage:new`

This lets every email sound *relevant*, not generic.

---

## 3. EMAIL SEQUENCES

### A) WAITLIST SEQUENCE (LOW PRESSURE, TRUST FIRST)

**Goal:**
Warm them up emotionally → invite when ready → avoid desperation.

---

### **Email W1 — Immediate**

**Subject:** You’re on the list.

**Body (short):**

> Thanks for joining.
>
> We’re opening access slowly to keep the experience calm and private.
>
> You’ll hear from us when your spot opens.
>
> No noise. No pressure.

**Tags:** `stage:waitlist`

---

### **Email W2 — +2 days**

**Subject:** Why Amplexa isn’t free

**Body:**

> We charge a small amount because it changes how people use the app.
>
> Free-only access leads to spam, bad behaviour, and unhelpful feedback.
>
> £0.99 filters for people who actually want the experience to be good.
>
> And if it’s not right for you, we refund. No arguments.

(Include refund@ email plainly.)

---

### **Email W3 — +4 days**

**Subject:** What people use Amplexa for

**Body (persona-aware):**

* **Lonely:** “Mostly at night. When you don’t want to explain yourself.”
* **Curious:** “Fantasy, roleplay, and conversations without censorship.”
* **Privacy:** “Quiet, predictable conversation without social pressure.”

End with:

> You don’t need to decide yet.
> We’ll invite you when it’s your turn.

---

### **Email W4 — INVITE**

**Subject:** Your access is open

**Body:**

> You can try Amplexa now.
>
> Start with three messages.
> Then choose:
> – £2.99/month
> – £0.99/month (locked in forever)

CTA: **Use Amplexa**

Tag: `stage:invited`

---

### **Email W5 — +48h (if no conversion)**

**Subject:** No rush

**Body:**

> Just a reminder your access is open.
>
> If it’s not the right time, that’s okay.
> Amplexa isn’t going anywhere.

---

## B) DIRECT-TO-APP SEQUENCE (CONVERSION-FOCUSED BUT ETHICAL)

**Goal:**
Turn first experience into paid use without coercion.

---

### **Email D1 — Immediate**

**Subject:** You’re in.

**Body:**

> You can start immediately.
>
> You’ll get three messages to see if it feels right.
>
> After that:
> – £2.99/month
> – £0.99/month forever (early users)

CTA: **Start now**

---

### **Email D2 — Triggered after 3 messages used**

**Subject:** Want to keep going?

**Body:**

> We limit free messages on purpose.
>
> People who pay—even a small amount—use Amplexa more thoughtfully.
> That makes the experience better for everyone.
>
> You’re not locked in.
> You can leave anytime.

CTA buttons:

* Continue for £0.99/month
* Continue for £2.99/month

---

### **Email D3 — +24h if not converted**

**Subject:** Not sure yet?

**Body:**

> If Amplexa isn’t what you expected, that’s okay.
>
> If you try it and don’t like it, just email **[refund@amplexa.ai](mailto:refund@amplexa.ai)**.
> A real person will handle it.

This email *increases* conversions by removing fear.

---

### **Email D4 — +72h soft close**

**Subject:** Last note

**Body:**

> We won’t keep emailing you.
>
> If you want to try again later, Amplexa will be here.

Tag: `stage:dormant`

---

## 4. TIMING & AUTOMATION RULES

**Critical rules:**

* Never send more than **1 email per 48h**
* No countdown timers
* No “last chance” language
* Silence is respected

This matches the product’s emotional tone.

---

## 5. REFUNDS & TRUST LOOP (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Refund Trigger

When `refund_requested = true`:

* Auto-reply:

> We’ve received your request.
> A human will review this shortly.

* Internal Slack / inbox notification to ops
* Refund processed → tag `refund_processed:true`

### Follow-up Email (after refund)

**Subject:** Thanks for trying Amplexa

> No hard feelings.
>
> If you ever want to try again, you’re welcome back.

This preserves goodwill + future return.

---

## 6. WHY THIS SYSTEM IMPROVES FEEDBACK QUALITY

You asked to **explain this clearly**, so here it is:

* Paying users behave differently
* They give clearer feedback
* They stay longer
* They treat the experience with respect

The funnel + CRM ensures:

* No trolls
* No drive-by abuse
* Fewer “this sucks” comments with no context
* More usable product insight

That’s why £0.99 is not a discount — it’s a **filter**.

---

## FINAL NOTE

This system:

* Feels human
* Respects autonomy
* Converts without pressure
* Protects brand trust

If you want next, I can:

* translate this into **HubSpot / Klaviyo / Customer.io**
* write **persona-specific email variants**
* design **in-app message equivalents**
* or build a **refund handling SOP** for ops

You’ve designed something unusually ethical for this space — this CRM setup protects that.
